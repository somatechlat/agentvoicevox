OpenVoiceOS (OVOS) is a collective of programmers and hardware enthusiasts dedicated to producing an open-source voice assistant. Originating in 2019-2020 as part of the Mycroft community, OVOS has grown to incorporate several third-party projects, evolving into an independent entity over time.

As MycroftAI's operations dwindled and development shifted to Neon, OVOS emerged as a crucial pillar of the open-source community. With our maintained code serving as the foundation for various projects, including Neon and KDE integrations, OVOS now represents the resilience of the Mycroft ecosystem.

To ensure OVOS's sustainability and expand our impact, we are establishing a nonprofit association under Dutch law: OpenVoiceOS V.z.w. ("Vereniging zonder winstoogmerk"), focused on supporting our community through legal and financial structures. This association will manage donations for software development, promotion, and support.

To kickstart this initiative and cover initial expenses, we aim to raise €3033. Your support through our [GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/openvoiceos) will enable us to achieve these goals and secure the future of privacy-focused, open-source voice assistants.

We deeply appreciate any contribution you can make and encourage you to reach out with questions or ideas. Stay tuned as we finalize our plans for long-term stability and structured development processes. Together, we can give voice to the future of open-source innovation.
